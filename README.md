# Salary Estimator using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Project Description

The "Salary Estimator using K-Nearest Neighbors" is a Python-based machine learning application designed to predict salaries based on various factors such as job position, experience, location, and education. Leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, this project aims to provide a user-friendly and effective tool for estimating salaries in a wide range of scenarios.

### Key Features

- **K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm:** The heart of this project is the K-NN algorithm, a versatile and intuitive machine learning technique. It allows the model to make predictions by finding the nearest neighbors in the dataset, making it suitable for salary estimation based on similar job roles and qualifications.

- **Simple and Intuitive Usage:** The application is designed to be user-friendly, enabling users to input job-related data and get salary estimates with ease. This simplicity makes it accessible to both data science professionals and those new to machine learning.

- **Customizability:** The codebase is structured in a way that allows for customization and extension. If you have additional data or specific requirements, you can easily adapt the model to your needs.
